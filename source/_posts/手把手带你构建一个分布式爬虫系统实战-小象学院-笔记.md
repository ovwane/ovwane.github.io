## pipenv

### macOS下安装pipenv

```bash
brew install pipenv
```

添加pipenv自动补全

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc

eval "$(pipenv --completion)"
```

初始化pipenv环境

```bash
mkdir ~/PycharmProjects/crawl_spider
cd ~/PycharmProjects/crawl_spider

pipenv --python=/Users/jinlong/.pyenv/versions/3.6.3/bin/python
```

修改pypi源

```bash
#linux
sed -i "s#python.org#douban.com#g" Pipfile

#macOS 和linux不同，需要加“”
sed -i "" "s#python.org#douban.com#g" Pipfile
```

切换到虚拟环境

```
cd ~/PycharmProjects/crawl_spider

pipenv shell
```
