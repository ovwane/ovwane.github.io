# [MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x+1T2019/course/)



## 运行环境

- macOS 10.13.6

- Anaconda3-2.5.0：Python 3.5.1

- IPython 4.0.3

- IDE([integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)): Spyder(Scientific Python Development Environment) 2.3.9



### 设置 Spyder

**启动 Spyder：**打开 Anaconda Navigator->Home->spyder->Launch

**运行前清除：**Preferences->Run->Clear all variables before execution



### 测试 Matplotlib 和 Numpy

## Resources to Help you Succeed

**You do not have to read through these at the start of the course. Come back to these resources as the course progresses!** 

**Add your own at the end of the list, by clicking "Show related resources", and rate ones you found useful!**

If you're having trouble with a particular concept or simply want to have access to more information, try one of the following links.



### Documentation

- [Official Python 3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) - "official"/technical explanation of what a particular function/operator does, examples of correct syntax, what the various libraries are, etc.



### Textbooks/Tutorials

- [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) - another survey of Python syntax, datatypes, etc.
- [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen Downey - a good general overview of the Python language. Includes exercises.
- [The Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - self-explanatory
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - (note: for Python 2) another free online text
- [Reserved Keywords in Python](https://docs.python.org/3.0/reference/lexical_analysis.html#id8) - don't use these as variable names
- [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) - Style Guide for Python Code - learn what is good and bad style in Python
- [CheckIO](https://checkio.org/) - learn Python by exploring a game world

- [Blog with tutorials](http://mitxcsjourney.blogspot.com/) - created by one of our community TAs



### Debugging

- [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/) - an excellent way to actually visualize how the interpreter actually reads and executes your code
- [DiffChecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) - compares two sets of text and shows you which lines are different
- [Debugging in Python](https://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/) - steps you can take to try to debug your program



### Software

- [Python Tools for Visual Studio](https://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/) - Visual Studio plug-in enabling Python programming



### Other Q&A

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) - a large Q&A forum for programming concepts (not just Python). Try searching here before you post on the edX forum, and you may find that someone has already answered your question.



### More practice problems

- [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) - a series of puzzles you can try to test your Python abilities
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - additional programming challenges you can try once your Python knowledge becomes stronger; problems are sorted by increasing difficulty
- [Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/python) - problems you can solve within an online interpreter
